The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a database value that doesn't exist or is not yet initialized. This can happen when you use asynchronous operations and try to access data before it has been fully loaded from the database. For example, if you attach a listener that immediately reads a value before the data is fetched, you'll get an error.  Another uncommon error occurs when using transactions; if the transaction fails due to network issues or conflicts, it can leave your data in an inconsistent state.  Incorrectly structuring your data can also cause unexpected behavior; deeply nested data can be cumbersome and may not work correctly with Firebase's query capabilities.
