# Uncommon Firebase Errors

This repository demonstrates and provides solutions for some less common errors encountered when using the Firebase Realtime Database. These include issues stemming from asynchronous data access, transaction failures, and inefficient data structuring.

The `firebaseBug.js` file contains code that replicates these problems.  `firebaseBugSolution.js` offers corrected implementations.

**Issues Covered:**

* **Asynchronous Data Access:** Incorrectly handling asynchronous operations can lead to attempts to access data before it's loaded from the database.
* **Transaction Failures:** Network problems or conflicts can cause transaction failures, leaving data inconsistent.
* **Inefficient Data Structures:** Poorly structured data can hinder querying and create unexpected behavior.

This repository aims to help developers identify and resolve these errors effectively.
